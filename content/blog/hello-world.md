## Why We're Starting a Blog

We're building the operating system for AI-native organizations — the coordination layer where humans and AI agents work as one system. This blog is where we'll share what we're learning along the way: the architecture decisions, the hard problems, and the emerging patterns of human-AI collaboration.

## What to Expect

Here's what we'll be writing about:

- **Product updates** — New features, improvements, and what's coming next
- **AI coordination** — How organizations are learning to work alongside AI agents
- **Engineering deep dives** — The infrastructure behind human-AI collaboration at scale
- **Building in public** — Honest takes on what's working, what isn't, and what we're learning

## Stay Tuned

We're just getting started. If you're building an AI-first organization — or thinking about it — we'd love to hear from you.
