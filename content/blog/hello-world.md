## Why We're Starting a Blog

Building a product is a journey, and we want to share ours with you. This blog is where we'll post updates about Exponential, share what we're learning about productivity, and dive into the tools and techniques that help solo founders ship faster.

## What to Expect

Here's what we'll be writing about:

- **Product updates** - New features, improvements, and what's coming next
- **Productivity insights** - Lessons learned from building and using our own tools
- **AI and automation** - How we're using AI to make project management smarter
- **Builder stories** - Conversations with founders who are shipping great products

## Stay Tuned

We're just getting started. If you have topics you'd like us to cover, we'd love to hear from you.
