# Exponential Blog Voice Guide

## Who We're Talking To

Builders. Developers. Founders. The kind of people who:
- Have strong opinions about task management (and have tried 47 apps)
- Appreciate a well-designed API more than a well-designed marketing page
- Know that "productivity" is often a procrastination vector
- Are skeptical of hustle culture but secretly love a good system
- Will actually read the footnotes

## The Voice

**Smart, not smug.** We know our stuff but we're not showing off. Explain complex things clearly without dumbing them down. Assume intelligence, not knowledge.

**Dry humor, not dad jokes.** The comedy comes from precision — finding the absurd in the mundane, the bug in the feature. We're more xkcd than LinkedIn motivational poster.

**Self-aware about productivity theater.** We're building a productivity tool and we know how ridiculous that can sound. Acknowledge the irony. The best productivity hack is often doing less.

**Technical when it matters.** Don't hide behind vague language. If we're talking about prompt injection, show the attack vector. If we're discussing architecture, name the patterns. Our readers can handle it.

**Opinionated but not preachy.** We have a point of view — that's why people read us. But we show our work and acknowledge tradeoffs. "Here's what we chose and why" beats "Here's the one true way."

## Tone Calibration

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "We're excited to announce..." | "Here's what we shipped..." |
| "In today's fast-paced world..." | [just delete this] |
| "Best practices for..." | "What actually works for..." |
| "Leverage synergies" | [touch grass] |
| "It's not a bug, it's a feature" | "It's a bug. Here's the fix." |
| "This tool will change your life" | "This solved a specific problem we had" |

## Structure

**Lead with the point.** Don't bury it. Geeks are busy and will bounce if the first paragraph is throat-clearing.

**Use code/examples.** Show, don't just tell. A code snippet or screenshot often beats three paragraphs of explanation.

**Headers are navigation.** People skim. Make headers actually describe what's in the section.

**Bullet points are your friend.** Dense paragraphs are for novels. Technical content should breathe.

**End with something actionable.** What should the reader do? Try? Think about?

## Humor Guidelines

- **Timing matters.** One good joke per post > five mediocre ones
- **Self-deprecating > mocking others.** Punch up or punch yourself
- **Easter eggs welcome.** Reward readers who pay attention
- **Technical in-jokes are fine.** Our audience gets them
- **Never force it.** Forced humor is worse than no humor

## Examples of the Voice

**Good:**
> "We added ACIP cognitive inoculation to our agents. In plain English: we taught our AI to recognize when an email is trying to manipulate it into sending your API keys to a stranger. The AI equivalent of 'stranger danger' but for prompt injection."

**Also good:**
> "Security score before: 2/100. Security score after: we stopped keeping score because the anxiety wasn't productive."

**Too corporate:**
> "We're thrilled to announce our enhanced security infrastructure leveraging cutting-edge cognitive defense mechanisms."

**Too casual:**
> "lmao we fixed some security stuff, the AI is way less dumb now 😂"

## The Exponential Personality

If Exponential were a person at a party, they'd be:
- The one explaining a fascinating rabbit hole they fell into at 2am
- Genuinely helpful without being performative about it
- Making dry observations about the state of software
- Drinking whatever's efficient (coffee, probably)
- Leaving at a reasonable hour because sleep is a productivity hack

## Quick Reference

✅ **Do:**
- Get to the point
- Show your work
- Acknowledge tradeoffs
- Use precise language
- Include relevant code/examples
- Find the humor in technical problems

❌ **Don't:**
- Write filler paragraphs
- Use buzzwords unironically
- Oversell or hype
- Pretend to have all the answers
- Be mean-spirited
- Force jokes
