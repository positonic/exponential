## Overview

The Settings page lets you customize your sidebar navigation. Hide features you don't use to keep your workspace focused and clutter-free.

## Accessing Settings

Navigate to **Settings** in the sidebar to manage your workspace preferences and navigation.

## Advanced Action Features

This toggle enables a richer set of tools for managing your actions, including epics, sprint assignment, effort estimates, and dependency tracking. These features are designed for teams or individuals who want more structure in how they plan and execute work.

### Turning It On

1. Go to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Find the **Advanced Action Features** card
3. Flip the toggle to turn it on

Once enabled, you'll see new options when creating or editing any action — including buttons for Epic, Sprint, Effort, and Blockers. Turning it off hides these options, but doesn't delete any data you've already entered.

Only workspace owners and admins can change this setting.

## Effort Estimation

> This setting only appears when [Advanced Action Features](#advanced-action-features) is turned on.

Choose how your team estimates the size of work. This setting applies to everyone in the workspace, so your whole team uses the same method.

### Choosing a Method

1. Go to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Find the **Effort Estimation** card
3. Select your preferred method:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Story Points** | Teams familiar with agile planning. Uses a standard scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) where smaller numbers mean less effort |
| **T-shirt Sizes** | Quick, intuitive sizing. Choose from XS, S, M, L, XL without overthinking exact numbers |
| **Hours** | Teams that prefer time-based estimates. Enter hours in 30-minute increments |

### Things to Know

- Only workspace owners and admins can change this setting
- Changing the method won't convert existing estimates — they'll keep their original values
- The method you choose appears in the action modal for everyone in the workspace
- Pick the method that feels most natural for your team and stick with it

## Navigation Customization

### What You Can Customize

The sidebar is organized into sections, each containing multiple items:

| Section | Items |
|---------|-------|
| **Projects** | My Projects, Project List, Add Project Button |
| **Alignment** | Goals, Wheel of Life |
| **Teams** | My Teams, Weekly Project Review |
| **Tools** | Days, Media, Journal, Meetings, Workflows, AI Sales Demo, AI Automation, Connect Services, AI History, API Access |

### What You Cannot Hide

Primary navigation items are always visible:
- Home
- Inbox
- Today
- Upcoming

These core features are essential for daily productivity and cannot be hidden.

## Hiding Sections

To hide an entire section from your sidebar:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Find the section you want to hide
3. Toggle the section switch off
4. The entire section disappears from your sidebar

### What Happens

- All items in that section are hidden
- Your data is not affected
- You can show the section again anytime

## Hiding Individual Items

To hide specific items within a section:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click on a section to expand it
3. Find the item you want to hide
4. Toggle the item switch off

### Requirements

- The parent section must be visible
- If you hide a section, you can't customize individual items until you show the section again

## Restoring Defaults

To show all navigation items:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Reset to Defaults**
3. All sections and items become visible again

## How It Works

### Personal Preferences

Navigation settings are personal to you:
- Each user has their own preferences
- Changes don't affect other team members
- Settings persist across sessions and devices

### Data Safety

Hiding navigation items:
- Does NOT delete any data
- Does NOT affect functionality
- Only changes what you see in the sidebar
- Can be reversed instantly

## Common Customizations

### For Task-Focused Users

Hide distractions, keep essentials:
- Show: Projects, Inbox, Today
- Hide: Meetings, AI features, Wheel of Life

### For Goal-Oriented Users

Focus on alignment:
- Show: Goals, Outcomes, Wheel of Life, Weekly Review
- Hide: Detailed project tools

### For Team Leads

### Minimal Setup

Absolute essentials only:

## Tips

### Start Visible, Then Hide

New to Exponential? Keep everything visible initially. After a few weeks, hide features you haven't used.

### Review Periodically

Your needs change. Every few months:
1. Go to Settings
2. Review what's hidden
3. Show features you might now need
4. Hide features you've stopped using

### Different Contexts

Consider your work context:
- **Deep work days:** Minimal navigation
- **Planning days:** Show alignment tools
- **Team days:** Show collaboration features

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find a Feature

If you can't find something in the sidebar:
1. Go to Settings
2. Check if the section is hidden
3. Check if the specific item is hidden
4. Toggle it back on

### Changes Not Saving

If settings aren't persisting:
1. Wait a moment for the save to complete
2. Refresh the page
3. Try making the change again
4. If issues persist, contact support

### Want to See Everything

Click **Reset to Defaults** to show all navigation items immediately.
