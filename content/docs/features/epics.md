description: Group related actions together into larger initiatives to see the bigger picture

## Overview

Sometimes a single action isn't enough to capture a bigger piece of work. That's where Epics come in. An epic is simply a way to group related actions together under one umbrella, so you can track progress on larger initiatives at a glance.

Think of epics like chapters in a book — each chapter (epic) contains several pages (actions) that all contribute to the same story.

### What You Can Do With Epics

- **Group related work** — Bundle actions that belong to the same initiative
- **Track progress** — See how many actions are complete within an epic
- **Set priorities** — Mark epics as High, Medium, or Low priority
- **Plan timelines** — Add optional start and target dates
- **Stay organized** — Keep your project boards clean and structured

## Creating an Epic

You can create an epic right from the action modal — no need to navigate away from what you're doing.

1. Open the **Create Action** or **Edit Action** modal
2. Click the **Epic** button
3. Click **New Epic** at the bottom of the list
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Name** — A clear title for the initiative (required)
   - **Description** — What this epic is about (optional)
   - **Priority** — How important is this initiative
   - **Start Date** — When work begins (optional)
   - **Target Date** — When you'd like it finished (optional)
5. Click **Create**

Your new epic is ready to use immediately.

## Assigning Actions to an Epic

Once you have an epic, you can link any action to it:

1. Open the **Create Action** or **Edit Action** modal
2. Click the **Epic** button
3. Browse or search your epics
4. Select the epic you want

The button turns purple to show the action is linked. You can change or remove the epic at any time by clicking the button again.

## Epic Statuses

Epics move through simple lifecycle stages:

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Open** | Work hasn't started yet or is in early stages |
| **In Progress** | The team is actively working on this |
| **Done** | All the work is complete |
| **Cancelled** | This initiative is no longer needed |

## Viewing Your Epics

When you select an epic, you'll see:

- All the actions that belong to it
- Who's assigned to each action
- Effort estimates for each action
- The overall status at a glance

This makes it easy to understand how a larger initiative is progressing without digging through individual actions.

## Tips for Using Epics Effectively

### Keep Epics Meaningful
An epic should represent a meaningful chunk of work — not too small (that's just an action) and not too large (that's more like a project). Good examples:
- "Redesign onboarding flow"
- "Q1 marketing campaign"
- "Payment system upgrade"

### Use Priorities
Set epic priorities to help your team understand what matters most. When you're deciding what to work on next, high-priority epics should get attention first.

### Set Target Dates
Even rough target dates help keep work on track. They give everyone a shared sense of when an initiative should wrap up.

### Review Regularly
Check in on your epics during weekly reviews. Are they progressing? Do any need to be reprioritized or cancelled?
