description: Process unassigned tasks and focus on your daily priorities

## Overview

The Inbox and Today views are your daily command center. Inbox captures unprocessed tasks while Today shows what needs attention right now.

## Inbox

The Inbox contains all actions without an assigned project. Think of it as your capture zone for thoughts, ideas, and tasks that need processing.

### When to Use Inbox

- Quick capture of ideas
- Tasks from external sources
- Items needing project assignment
- Temporary holding area

### Processing Inbox

The goal is to keep Inbox empty through regular processing:

1. **Review each item**: Does this need to be done?
2. **Assign a project**: Where does this work belong?
3. **Set a due date**: When should it be done?
4. **Set priority**: How important is it?
5. **Or delete**: Is it actually needed?

### Inbox Zero

Aim for Inbox Zero through:
- Daily inbox processing
- Quick project assignment
- Deleting unnecessary items
- Converting to reference notes

### Inbox Sources

Actions arrive in Inbox from:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Quick capture | Manual entry without project |
| iOS Shortcuts | External capture without project |
| API creation | Programmatic creation |
| Imports | External syncs without mapping |
