description: Extend Exponential with modular plugins for OKRs, CRM, and more
---

## Overview

Exponential uses a modular plugin system that allows you to enable or disable features based on your needs. Each plugin adds specific functionality to your workspace, such as new navigation items, dashboard widgets, and specialized tools.

Plugins are workspace-scoped, meaning you can enable different plugins for different workspaces. For example, you might enable the CRM plugin for your sales workspace but not for your personal workspace.

## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| [OKRs](/docs/features/okr) | Track objectives and key results aligned with your goals | Enabled |
| [CRM](/docs/features/crm) | Manage contacts, organizations, and interactions | Enabled |

## Managing Plugins

### Enabling and Disabling Plugins

1. Navigate to your workspace settings
2. Click on **Plugins** in the sidebar
3. Toggle plugins on or off as needed
4. Changes take effect immediately

### Plugin Capabilities

Plugins can provide different types of functionality:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Navigation** | Adds items to the sidebar menu |
| **Dashboard Widgets** | Displays widgets on your main dashboard |
| **Settings** | Provides plugin-specific configuration options |
| **Workspace Scoped** | Data is isolated per workspace |

## Plugin Features

### Sidebar Navigation

When a plugin is enabled, its navigation items appear in the sidebar. Plugins are organized into sections:

- **Main** - Core features like CRM
- **Alignment** - Strategic planning tools like OKRs

### Dashboard Widgets

Some plugins add widgets to your dashboard. The OKR plugin, for example, shows a progress summary widget displaying your current objectives and key results progress.

### Workspace Isolation

All plugin data is scoped to your current workspace. This means:

- OKRs in one workspace are separate from OKRs in another
- CRM contacts are isolated per workspace
- Plugin settings can differ between workspaces

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your workspace** - Select the workspace where you want to configure plugins
2. **Go to Settings > Plugins** - Find the plugin management page
3. **Enable the plugins you need** - Toggle on the features you want to use
4. **Start using the features** - New navigation items will appear in your sidebar
