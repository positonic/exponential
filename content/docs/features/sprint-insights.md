description: Get real-time sprint tracking, risk detection, and daily standups from your AI assistant

## Overview

Sprint Insights gives you a clear picture of how your sprint is going without digging through boards and charts. Ask Paddy -- your AI assistant -- simple questions about progress, risks, and daily activity, and get structured summaries you can act on right away. It works from the chat interface or WhatsApp.

## How It Works

Paddy automatically has access to your sprint board and development activity. There is no extra setup required beyond having an active sprint running in your project. When you ask a question, Paddy pulls together the latest data from your tasks, commits, and pull requests to give you an up-to-date answer.

## What You Can Ask

- **Sprint status** -- How many tasks are done, in progress, or still to do. A quick snapshot of where things stand.
- **Morning standup** -- A structured summary to kick off your day: what was completed yesterday, what is planned for today, and anything that needs attention.
- **Evening wrapup** -- A summary of what got done today, what moved forward, and what is still outstanding.
- **Risk check** -- Are any tasks stuck, overdue, or showing signs of scope creep? Paddy flags potential problems before they become blockers.
- **Sprint review** -- A full retrospective-style overview of the sprint: what was accomplished, what was missed, and how the team performed.
- **Development activity** -- What code was committed, which pull requests were merged, and how that maps to sprint tasks.

## Example Conversations

**Checking sprint progress:**

```
"What's the sprint status?"
```

Paddy responds with a breakdown of tasks by status (done, in progress, to do), your completion rate, and how you are tracking against the sprint timeline.

**Starting your day:**

```
"Give me a morning standup"
```

You get a structured summary: what was completed since yesterday, what is on the plan for today, and any blockers or risks to be aware of.

**Spotting problems early:**

```
"Any risks I should know about?"
```

Paddy checks for tasks that have been in progress too long, items past their due date, and work that was added after the sprint started. You get a clear list of what needs attention.

**Wrapping up a sprint:**

```
"How did the sprint go?"
```

A full sprint review with completion stats, velocity compared to previous sprints, scope changes, and highlights of what was delivered.

## Understanding Your Sprint Data

### Completion Rate

The percentage of planned tasks that are finished. If your sprint started with 20 tasks and 15 are done, your completion rate is 75%. This helps you see at a glance whether you are on track to finish the sprint.

### Velocity

A measure of how much work was completed in the sprint, based on effort estimates. Tracking velocity over multiple sprints helps you plan more realistically -- you can see how much your team typically gets done and set expectations accordingly.

### Scope Creep

Tasks that were added to the sprint after it started. A small amount of added work is normal, but if a lot of new tasks keep appearing, it can put the original plan at risk. Paddy tracks this so you can have informed conversations about priorities.

### Risk Signals

Paddy watches for patterns that might cause problems:

- **Stuck tasks** -- Work that has been in progress for an unusually long time without updates
- **Overdue items** -- Tasks past their due date that have not been completed
- **Blocked work** -- Tasks waiting on something else before they can move forward
- **Uneven workload** -- Too much work concentrated on one person or area

## Tips for Better Insights

- **Keep your sprint board up to date.** Move tasks to the right columns as work progresses. The more accurate your board, the more useful Paddy's insights will be.
- **Set due dates on important tasks.** This lets Paddy detect overdue items and warn you before deadlines slip.
- **Use effort estimates.** Adding estimates to your tasks gives you more accurate velocity tracking and helps with future sprint planning.
- **Connect GitHub for development activity.** Linking your repository lets Paddy include commit and pull request data in sprint summaries.
