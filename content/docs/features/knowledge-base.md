# Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base lets you save documents, web pages, and notes alongside your meeting transcriptions. All content is indexed for AI-powered semantic search, so your AI assistant can find relevant information across everything you've saved.

## What You Can Store

- **Web Pages** - Save articles, documentation, or any web content
- **Documents** - Store text documents and notes
- **Meeting Transcriptions** - Automatically indexed from your meetings
- **Bookmarks** - Quick references to important URLs

## How It Works

When you save content to the Knowledge Base:

1. **Content is cleaned** - HTML is stripped, text is extracted
2. **Text is chunked** - Content is split into searchable segments
3. **AI embeddings are generated** - Each chunk gets a semantic fingerprint
4. **Stored for search** - Content becomes searchable by meaning, not just keywords

## AI-Powered Search

Unlike traditional keyword search, the Knowledge Base uses **semantic search**. This means:

- Search by meaning, not exact words
- Find related content even with different terminology
- Get relevant results ranked by similarity

### Example

If you saved an article about "machine learning optimization" and search for "how to improve AI model performance", the system understands these are related and returns the article.

## Project Context

Content can be associated with specific projects. When chatting with your AI assistant about a project, it automatically has access to:

- Meeting transcriptions for that project
- Documents and resources you've saved to that project
- Web pages you've bookmarked for reference

This gives your AI assistant the context it needs to provide relevant, informed responses.

## Content Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Web Page | Saved web content with URL | Articles, documentation, references |
| Document | Text content without a URL | Notes, drafts, internal docs |
| Bookmark | URL reference with minimal content | Quick links, read-later items |
| Note | Short text snippets | Quick thoughts, reminders |

## Privacy

Your Knowledge Base content is:

- Private to your account
- Only searchable by you and your AI assistant
- Never shared with other users
- Scoped to your projects and workspaces
