## Overview

The Goals and Outcomes system creates a hierarchy of alignment from your life vision down to daily tasks. This ensures every action you take contributes to meaningful progress.

### The Alignment Hierarchy

```
Goals (Strategic Vision)
    ↓
Outcomes (Measurable Results)
    ↓
Projects (Execution Vehicles)
    ↓
Actions (Daily Tasks)
```

## Goals

Goals represent your strategic vision organized by life domains. They answer the question: "What do I want to achieve in this area of my life?"

### Life Domains

Goals are categorized into life domains:

| Domain | Focus Area |
|--------|------------|
| Career/Business | Professional growth, job satisfaction |
| Finance/Wealth | Financial security, investments |
| Health/Fitness | Physical health, energy, nutrition |
| Family/Relationships | Family connections |
| Romance/Partnership | Romantic relationships |
| Personal Growth | Learning, skills development |
| Fun/Recreation | Hobbies, leisure, play |
| Physical Environment | Home, workspace |
| Social/Friends | Friendships, community |
| Spirituality/Purpose | Meaning, values, purpose |

### Creating a Goal

1. Navigate to **Goals** from the sidebar
2. Click **New Goal**
3. Select the life domain
4. Enter goal details:
   - **Title**: Clear statement of what you want
   - **Description**: Context and motivation
   - **Why This Goal**: Your deeper motivation
   - **Due Date**: Target completion (optional)
5. Link supporting outcomes and projects
6. Click **Create**

### Goal Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Title | What you want to achieve |
| Description | Context and details |
| Why This Goal | Deeper motivation |
| Notes | Additional thoughts |
| Due Date | Target completion |
| Life Domain | Category (required) |
| Outcomes | Supporting measurable results |

## Outcomes

Outcomes are measurable results with specific time horizons. They answer: "What specific result will move my goal forward?"

### Outcome Types

| Type | Horizon | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Daily | Today | Immediate focus items |
| Weekly | This week | Weekly milestones |
| Monthly | This month | Monthly objectives |
| Quarterly | This quarter | Quarterly goals |

   - **Description**: Specific measurable result
   - **Due Date**: Target date
   - **Why This Outcome**: Motivation
5. Link to a supporting goal

### Outcome Best Practices

**Make Outcomes Specific**

Instead of:
> "Make progress on fitness"

Write:
> "Complete 30 miles of running this week"

**Time-Bound Results**

Match the outcome type to the timeframe:
- Daily: Achievable today
- Weekly: Realistic for the week
- Quarterly: Ambitious but achievable

## The Alignment Flow

### From Vision to Action

2. **Create Supporting Outcomes**:
   - Weekly: "Complete 30 miles of training"
   - Monthly: "Increase max distance by 5 miles"
   - Quarterly: "Finish half-marathon"
3. **Link to a Project**: "Marathon Training Program"
4. **Execute via Actions**:
