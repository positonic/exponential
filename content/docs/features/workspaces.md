description: Organize your work into separate containers for personal, team, and client projects
---

## Overview

Workspaces are containers that keep your work organized and separate. Think of them like separate accounts within Exponential - each workspace has its own projects, goals, actions, and team members.

## When to Use Workspaces

| Scenario | Workspace Type |
|----------|---------------|
| Personal productivity | Personal workspace (created automatically) |
| Company projects | Team or Organization workspace |
| Client work | Separate workspace per client |
| Side projects | Additional personal workspaces |

## Your Personal Workspace

When you sign up, Exponential creates a personal workspace automatically. This workspace is private to you and perfect for:

- Personal tasks and projects
- Individual goal tracking
- Private notes and journals

## Creating a New Workspace

1. Click the **workspace switcher** in the sidebar (shows your current workspace name)
2. Click **New Workspace**
3. Enter a workspace name
4. Add an optional description
5. Click **Create**

### Workspace Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the workspace |
| **Slug** | URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated) |
| **Description** | Optional description of the workspace purpose |
| **Type** | Personal, Team, or Organization |

## Switching Workspaces

To switch between workspaces:

1. Click the workspace switcher in the sidebar
2. Select the workspace you want to view
3. The sidebar and all data will update to show that workspace's content

Your current workspace is always shown in the sidebar.

## Workspace Settings

Access workspace settings by navigating to **Settings** within your workspace.

### General Settings

Workspace owners and admins can edit:

- **Name** - Change the workspace display name
- **Description** - Update the workspace description
- **Slug** - View the URL identifier (cannot be changed after creation)
- **Type** - View the workspace type badge

### Editing Workspace Details

1. Go to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Click **Edit Settings** in the General section
3. Update the name or description
4. Click **Save Changes**

## Member Management

Workspaces can have multiple members with different access levels.

### Member Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, can delete workspace, manage all settings |
| **Admin** | Manage members, edit settings, full content access |
| **Member** | View and edit content, cannot manage settings |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to workspace content |

### Inviting Members

1. Go to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter the person's email address
4. Select a role (Admin, Member, or Viewer)
5. Click **Send Invitation**

### Invitation Process

When you invite someone:

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| User has an account | Added to workspace immediately |
| User is new | Receives invitation link (valid for 7 days) |

### Managing Pending Invitations

In workspace settings, you can see pending invitations with:

- Email address of invitee
- Role assigned
- Expiration date
- Who sent the invitation

**Actions available:**
- Copy invite link
- Resend invitation (generates new link)
- Cancel invitation

### Removing Members

1. Go to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Find the member in the Members table
3. Click the trash icon to remove them
4. Confirm the removal

**Note:** You cannot remove the workspace owner.

## Teams Within Workspaces

Workspaces can have teams linked to them for organizing collaboration.

### Teams Section in Settings

The Teams section shows three categories:

1. **Linked to this workspace** - Teams already connected
2. **Available to link** - Your teams not yet linked
3. **Linked to other workspaces** - Your teams used elsewhere

### Linking Teams

If you own a team:
1. Find it in "Available to link"
2. Click to link it to the current workspace
3. Team members can now access workspace content

### Team Information Displayed

For each team you can see:
- Team name
- Your role (Owner badge if applicable)
- Member count
- Project count
- Team member avatars

See [Teams](/docs/features/teams) for detailed team documentation.

## Plugins and Workspaces

Each workspace can have different plugins enabled.

### Plugin Isolation

- Plugin data is scoped to the workspace
- OKRs in one workspace are separate from another
- CRM contacts are workspace-specific
- Plugin settings can differ between workspaces

### Managing Plugins

1. Go to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Click **Plugins**
3. Toggle plugins on or off

See [Plugins](/docs/features/plugins) for available plugins.

## Best Practices

### For Personal Use

- Use your default personal workspace for individual tasks
- Create separate workspaces for major side projects
- Keep work and personal completely separated

### For Teams

- Create one workspace per team or department
- Invite team members with appropriate roles
- Use Admin role sparingly
- Keep Member role for most users

### For Agencies/Consultants

- Create one workspace per client
- Keep client data completely isolated
- Use descriptive workspace names
- Document workspace purpose in descriptions

### Naming Conventions

Good workspace names:
- "Marketing Team"
- "Client: Acme Corp"
- "Personal Projects"
- "Product Development"

## Data Isolation

Workspaces provide complete data separation:

| What's Isolated | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| Projects | Projects in one workspace don't appear in another |
| Actions | Tasks are workspace-specific |
| Goals & Outcomes | Strategic alignment is per-workspace |
| CRM Data | Contacts and organizations are isolated |
| OKRs | Objectives are workspace-scoped |

This means you can:
- Maintain confidentiality between clients
- Keep personal and work data separate
- Organize different areas of your life independently

## Common Questions

### Can I move data between workspaces?

Currently, data cannot be moved between workspaces. Plan your workspace structure carefully before creating lots of content.

### Can I be in multiple workspaces?

Yes. You can be a member of as many workspaces as you need and switch between them freely.

### What happens when I leave a workspace?

You lose access to all data in that workspace. Your data is not deleted - other members can still see it.

### Can I delete a workspace?

Workspace owners can delete workspaces. This permanently removes all data in the workspace.
