## Overview

After creating your account, you can configure Exponential to match your workflow. This guide covers workspace setup, navigation preferences, and plugin configuration.

## Your First Workspace

When you sign up, Exponential creates a personal workspace for you automatically. You can use this workspace for individual productivity, or create additional workspaces for teams and organizations.

### Workspace Types

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Personal** | Individual tasks, personal goals, private projects |
| **Team** | Small groups collaborating on shared projects |

Your new workspace will have its own projects, goals, actions, and settings separate from other workspaces.

## Navigation Preferences

Customize your sidebar to show only the features you use.

2. **Create one project first** - Add your most important current project
3. **Add daily actions** - Try the Today view to manage daily tasks
4. **Explore gradually** - Enable features as you need them

### For Teams

1. **Create a team workspace** - Keep team projects separate from personal work
2. **Invite members with appropriate roles** - Owners and Admins can manage settings
3. **Configure Slack integration** - Keep the team informed with automated updates
4. **Set up Fireflies** - Automatically capture meeting action items

## Common Questions

### Can I have multiple workspaces?

Yes. You can create as many workspaces as you need. Each workspace is completely separate with its own data, settings, and team members.

### Will hiding navigation items delete my data?

No. Hiding navigation items only affects what you see in the sidebar. Your data remains intact and you can show the items again anytime.

### Can different team members have different navigation settings?

Yes. Navigation preferences are personal. Each user can customize their own sidebar without affecting other team members.
