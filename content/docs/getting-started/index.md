## Welcome to Exponential

Exponential helps you organize projects, track tasks, achieve goals, and work smarter with AI assistance. This guide will have you productive in under 5 minutes.

## Create Your Account

Sign up using one of these authentication methods:

| Provider | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Google** | Quick signup with your existing Google account |
| **Discord** | Great if you use Discord for work |
| **Notion** | Connects with your Notion workspace |

After signing in, you'll land in your personal workspace - your private space for individual productivity.

## Your First 5 Minutes

### 1. Explore Your Workspace

When you first sign in, you'll see:
- **Sidebar** on the left with navigation
- **Home** showing your dashboard
- **Today** view for daily tasks
- **Inbox** for capturing quick thoughts

### 2. Create Your First Project

Projects organize related work together.

1. Click **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Q1 Marketing Campaign")
4. Add an optional description
5. Set priority to **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**
6. Click **Create**

Your project is now ready for tasks.

### 3. Add Your First Action

Actions are tasks that need to get done.

1. Open your new project
2. Click **Add Action**
3. Enter what you need to do (e.g., "Draft campaign brief")
4. Set a due date if needed
5. Click **Create**

Or use **Today** view:
1. Navigate to **Today** in the sidebar
2. Type your task in the input field
3. Press Enter

### 4. Check Your Today View

The **Today** view shows:
- Tasks due today
- Tasks you've scheduled for today
- Your daily focus area

This is where you'll spend most of your time during the workday.

### 5. Capture Ideas in Inbox

Got a quick thought? Don't let it slip away:

1. Go to **Inbox** in the sidebar
2. Type your idea
3. Press Enter

Later, you can organize inbox items into projects and actions.

## Quick Wins Checklist

Complete these to get comfortable with Exponential:

- [ ] Create one project
- [ ] Add three actions to your project
- [ ] Visit the Today view
- [ ] Capture one idea in Inbox
- [ ] Check out the Goals page

## Understanding the Sidebar

Your sidebar is organized into sections:

| Section | What It's For |
|---------|---------------|
| **Home** | Dashboard overview |
| **Inbox** | Quick capture |
| **Today** | Daily task focus |
| **Upcoming** | Future tasks and deadlines |
| **Projects** | All your projects |
| **Goals** | Strategic objectives |
| **Journal** | Daily reflection |

**Tip:** You can customize which items appear in your sidebar. See [Settings](/docs/features/settings).

## Core Concepts

### Projects vs Actions

- **Projects** = Containers for related work (like folders)
- **Actions** = Individual tasks to complete (like files)

A project might be "Website Redesign" containing actions like "Create wireframes" and "Review copy."

### Goals & Outcomes

For strategic alignment:
- **Goals** = What you want to achieve (e.g., "Increase revenue")
- **Outcomes** = Measurable results (e.g., "Close 5 deals this quarter")

Link projects to goals to ensure your daily work supports your strategy.

### Workspaces

Workspaces keep data separate:
- **Personal** workspace = Your individual tasks
- **Team** workspace = Shared team projects
- **Client** workspace = Client-specific work

You can switch workspaces anytime using the workspace switcher in the sidebar.
