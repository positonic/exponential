Weekly planning is the highest-leverage habit a founder can build.

Not daily planning — too granular, too fragile. Not quarterly planning — too distant, too abstract. Weekly planning sits at the sweet spot where strategy meets execution.

But most weekly planning systems are designed for people with predictable schedules. Founders need something different.

## Why Weekly?

The week is the natural unit of founder work because:

1. **It's long enough to make progress.** You can ship a feature, close a deal, or make a hire in a week.
2. **It's short enough to adapt.** If the week goes sideways, you've only lost a week. You course-correct next Monday.
3. **It creates rhythm.** Startups are chaotic. A weekly rhythm gives you one stable anchor in the chaos.
4. **It enables accountability.** "What did I accomplish this week?" is a question you can answer honestly.

## The Founder Weekly Planning System

This system has three parts. Total time: 30-45 minutes per week.

### Part 1: The Weekly Review (15-20 minutes)

Do this on Friday afternoon or Sunday evening. The goal is to close out the current week honestly.

**Step 1: Capture loose threads (5 min)**

Go through your inbox, messages, notes, and calendar from the week. Capture anything that's unresolved into your system. The goal is to get everything out of your head and into a trusted place.

**Step 2: Review outcomes (5 min)**

Look at the outcomes you set for this week:
- Which ones did you hit?
- Which ones did you miss? Why?
- Are there patterns? (Always overcommitting? Always getting derailed by fires?)

Be honest. The review only works if you're straight with yourself.

**Step 3: Review projects (5 min)**

For each active project:
- What moved this week?
- What's blocking progress?
- Does this project still matter given what you know now?

Kill projects that no longer serve your goals. This is hard but necessary. Every dead project you keep alive steals attention from the living ones.

### Part 2: Weekly Planning (10-15 minutes)

Do this Sunday evening or Monday morning. The goal is to set your intention for the week ahead.

**Step 1: Check goals (2 min)**

Revisit your quarterly goals. Not to update them — just to re-ground yourself in what matters. Everything you plan for the week should connect to these.

**Step 2: Set 3-5 weekly outcomes (5 min)**

An outcome is not a task. It's a result you want to be true by Friday.

Bad: "Work on investor deck"
Good: "Investor deck v2 complete and sent to 3 advisors for feedback"

Bad: "Hiring stuff"
Good: "Senior engineer role posted on 3 job boards with clear role description"

Outcomes are specific, measurable, and connected to a goal. Limit yourself to 3-5. If you set 10 outcomes, you'll hit 2 and feel terrible. If you set 3, you'll hit 3 and carry momentum into the next week.

**Step 3: Identify the rocks (5 min)**

For each outcome, identify the one or two actions that matter most. These are your "rocks" — the things that must happen for the outcome to be achieved.

Schedule these into your calendar as time blocks. Protect them. If something has to give during the week, it shouldn't be your rocks.

### Part 3: Daily Execution (2-3 minutes per day)

Each morning, glance at your weekly outcomes and your calendar. Ask:

- What's the highest-impact thing I can do in my next available block?
- Is anything at risk?

That's it. Don't re-plan. Don't reorganize. Just orient and execute.

If you have an AI-native execution system, this step is even simpler: the system tells you what matters today based on your weekly outcomes and current context.

## The Weekly Streak

One of the most powerful parts of this system is the streak.

Complete your weekly review every week and track the streak. 4 weeks becomes 8 becomes 16. The streak creates healthy pressure to maintain the habit.

Miss a week? Reset the counter and start again. No guilt. The system is forgiving by design.

## Common Mistakes

### Setting Too Many Outcomes

The most common mistake. You feel ambitious on Sunday night and set 7 outcomes. By Wednesday, you're already behind and the week feels like a failure.

**Fix**: Max 5 outcomes. Ideally 3. You can always add more mid-week if you finish early.

### Confusing Tasks and Outcomes

"Send follow-up email" is a task. "Close partnership deal with Acme Corp" is an outcome. Tasks are activities. Outcomes are results.

**Fix**: For each outcome, ask "If this is true by Friday, will it matter?" If yes, it's an outcome. If not, it's a task that serves a bigger outcome.

### Skipping the Review

Planning without reviewing is like navigating without looking at where you've been. You'll repeat the same mistakes and overcommit in the same ways.

**Fix**: The review comes first. Always. Even if you skip the planning, do the review.

### Planning in Isolation

Your weekly plan needs to account for what's already on your calendar. A week with 20 hours of meetings can't hold 5 ambitious outcomes.

**Fix**: Check your calendar before setting outcomes. Be realistic about your available time.

## How AI Enhances Weekly Planning

With an AI-native system, weekly planning gets significantly easier:

- **Automatic review prep**: The system summarizes what happened this week — tasks completed, projects moved, outcomes hit or missed — so you don't have to reconstruct it manually.
- **Smart outcome suggestions**: Based on your goals and current project status, the system suggests relevant outcomes for the coming week.
- **Calendar-aware planning**: The system knows your meeting load and adjusts how many outcomes are realistic.
- **Progress tracking**: Throughout the week, the system tracks your progress toward outcomes and alerts you if something is at risk.

This reduces the weekly planning session from 30-45 minutes to 15-20 minutes while making it more effective.
