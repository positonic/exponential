{"id":"exponential-14w","title":"Action project dropdown missing cross-workspace projects","description":"When editing an Action in personal workspace, the project dropdown doesn't show projects from other workspaces (e.g., can't find mvp_development project at /projects/mvp_development-cmlf3zmw40005l804w0eg28p4). Project dropdown should either show all accessible projects across workspaces or allow cross-workspace project assignment.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"jamespfarrell@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T23:30:02.269819+01:00","created_by":"positonic","updated_at":"2026-02-11T23:30:02.269819+01:00"}

Actions remain showing in today and appear overdue. Expected behavior: reschedule should update DoDate (the scheduled date), and if DueDate is before the new DoDate, DueDate should also be updated to match.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"jamespfarrell@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T23:22:03.975094+01:00","created_by":"positonic","updated_at":"2026-02-11T23:22:03.975094+01:00"}
