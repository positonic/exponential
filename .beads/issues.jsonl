{"id":"exponential-bye","title":"Docs: Public Bounty Board architecture \u0026 contributor guide","description":"Create documentation for the Public Bounty Board feature after Phase 1 implementation is complete.\n\n## What to Document\n\n### Architecture Documentation (docs/BOUNTY_BOARD.md)\n- How the bounty system extends the existing Action model\n- Public vs authenticated route architecture (/explore routes, unauthenticated tRPC publicProcedures)\n- Wallet-based auth flow (Silk SDK → EIP-191/4361 signature → User.walletAddress persistence)\n- BountyClaim lifecycle: OPEN → CLAIMED → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED → PAID\n- Access control changes: how isPublic on Project + isBounty on Action gate public visibility\n- Data exposure rules: what's public (bounty details, project name) vs private (internal tasks, financials)\n\n### Contributor Guide (public-facing)\n- How to browse bounties on /explore\n- How to connect wallet and create pseudonymous profile\n- Claim flow: claim → work → submit (PR link/deliverable URL + notes) → review\n- Deadline expectations (default 14 days, auto-expire on miss)\n- Trust tiers overview (Phase 3 preview)\n\n### Project Owner Guide\n- How to mark a project as public and flag actions as bounties\n- Setting bounty amount, token, skills, difficulty, deadline, max claimants\n- Reviewing submissions: approve / request changes / reject\n- Payment flow (Phase 2: direct wallet payment on Base L2 with USDC)\n\n## Strategic Context (from initial design discussion)\n\n### Why This Exists\nThe goal is to transform Exponential from a closed project management tool into a self-sovereign development platform. Any org or project on the platform can open specific tasks as paid bounties, attracting pseudonymous contributors via wallet identity and paying them in crypto — without leaving their existing workflow.\n\n### Key Architectural Insight\nBuilding this inside Exponential (rather than as a separate bounty platform) means project owners don't context-switch. The flow is: create tasks as normal → flag some as bounties → contributors find and claim them → owner reviews in their normal workflow → payment released. This is the core differentiator from standalone bounty platforms like Gitcoin or Bount.ing.\n\n### Existing Building Blocks Leveraged\n- Project.isPublic field (already existed, indexed, in access control)\n- Silk Wallet SDK (already in package.json, HumanButton component)\n- Scoring/Leaderboard models (DailyScore, ProductivityStreak, LeaderboardEntry)\n- Action model with effortEstimate, kanbanStatus, dependencies, assignees\n- Tags system (workspace-scoped)\n- ProjectMember with roles and responsibilities\n- 5-path access control system (creator, project member, team member, workspace member, public)\n\n### Phased Approach\n- Phase 1: Public board + bounty fields + wallet auth + claim flow (no payments yet)\n- Phase 2: Crypto payments (direct wallet-to-wallet on Base L2, USDC)\n- Phase 2.5: Escrow smart contract (funds held until approval)\n- Phase 3: Reputation system (contributor tiers, project reputation)\n- Phase 4: DAO governance (token-gated access, community voting — future)\n\n### Design Decisions Captured\n- Scope: Platform-wide, any org/project (not just internal)\n- Payment: Crypto only (Base L2 recommended for low fees + USDC support)\n- Identity: Pseudonymous via wallet (no email required for contributor accounts)\n- Governance: Project owner controls what's open (DAO governance deferred to Phase 4)\n- Starting chain: Base (Coinbase L2) for low gas, native USDC, good tooling\n- Payment model: Direct payment first (Option A), escrow later (Option B, Phase 2.5)\n- Auth: tRPC publicProcedure for unauthenticated endpoints, walletAuthProcedure for contributor actions\n\n### Open Questions (to address in docs)\n1. Platform fee: Should Exponential take a % of bounty payments?\n2. Dispute resolution: Manual for now, but needs a documented process\n3. KYC/AML: At what threshold do we need identity verification?\n4. Multi-chain: Start Base-only or multi-chain from day 1?\n5.
